#Jarbis

Simple 2wheeled mobile robot. Going to use a beaglebone, two stepper motors and
IR sensors.

##Project structure

The project is divided in four layers:

0. Physical layer (can be overriden by a physical layer simulator)
1. Hardware abstraction layer
2. Control and data acquisition layer
3. User layer (AI or UI for operator)

Each layer has its own substructure, hence the folders' configuration on the
first level of the project.
